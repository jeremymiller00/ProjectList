# ProjectList
A list and basic description of data science projects

## Project Currently in Production / Completed
### Retrain and Update Manuscript Matcher
Manuscript Matcher takes a manuscript title and abstract and return suggested journals for submission. 
* Created dataset using the last five years of published Title and Abstract from WoS.
* Filtered data down to ~8 million records by removing journals with low publishing frequency and known bad actors.
* Retrained a Fasttext-like FFNN in Tensorflow. Also updated Tensorflow code to enhance forward compatibility.
* Evaluated model using Recall at 1, 5, and 10.
* Performed error analysis based on number of observations by journal.

### A/B Testing for Reviewer Connect Service
Collect and analyze data from two versions of Reviewer Connect peer reviewer recommender to determine which is more effective.
* Used java data extraction tool on ec2 to acquire Reviewer Connect data.
* Performed Bayesian A/B testing by modeling selection rate as a binomial distribution.
* Confirmed results of Bayesian A/B testing with traditional Frequentist Hypothesis test.
* Wrote and delivered report to stakeholders with test results and plain text description.

### Data Reporting Pipeline for Peer Reviewer Recommendation System
Gather, analyze, and present monthly usage data from Reviewer Connect.
* Worked with Product Manager to define metrics.
* Worked with developers to establish pipeline for data acquisition
* Created and refined data reporting format focusing on visual representations (plots) and plain text descriptions.

### Java implementation of RAKE for keyword extraction and TextRank for key sentence extraction  
This project was about halfway completed when I took it over. I have completed the baseline implementations while ensembling a logistic regression model to classify a text token as part of the desired output or not. Since these unsupervised techniques are difficult to evaluate, the next step will be to ensemble a Java implementation of LexRank and use labeled user data to train a supervised ensemble whose features are the scores of the three individual models. 

### Logistic Regression Body Text Classifier.
Written in Scala and trained using Apache Spark. This classifier used part-of-speech tags to classify a given sentence of an academic manuscript as either a "body-text sentence" or not. Precision = 0.90; Recall = 0.90.

### Java implementation of LexRank for extractive summarization
The scores of these three algorithms together form the features of a logistic regression model to rank key sentences for rapid manuscript evaluation.

## Projects in Development
### Add Conflict of Interest by Organization Data to Peer Review Recommendations
Fuzzy comparison of author institutions with each potential reviewer institution to identify potential conflict of interest in peer reviewer recommendation. Comparison made with Jaro-Winkler similarity score. Threshold identified by training a Logistic Regression model with JW as the single feature.

### Predicting Peer Review Suitability for Manuscript Submissions
Given a new manuscript submission to an academic journal, what is the probability of it passing first-line review?
Deep learning FFNN with seven fully connected layers.

### PubMatch Validation
Trained logistic regression model to predict if matched publication is desired publication in metadata search. Features are similarity scores of metadata fields (title, abstract, etc..)

### Manuscript Pre-fill - Data Extraction
Given a new manuscript submission, extract and pre-fill the fields author, title, abstract, institution, funder.

### LDA Topic Modeling Proof-of-Concept
Train and visualize Latent Dirichlet Allocation model to identify subtopics in scientific academic publishing.

### Calviz Caltrain future use projection visualization challenge
Worked as part of team to produce a submission to visualize the future ridership and train schedule data under three different funding projections.

### Predicting Success in Online Education
Train Random Forest model to predict final success in online college courses using student interaction data from the first 25% of the course. Metrics:
