## Java implementation of RAKE for keyword extraction and TextRank for key sentence extraction  

This project was about halfway completed when I took it over. I have completed the baseline implementations while ensembling a logistic regression model to classify a text token as part of the desired output or not. Since these unsupervised techniques are difficult to evaluate, the next step will be to ensemble a Java implementation of LexRank and use labeled user data to train a supervised ensemble whose features are the scores of the three individual models.
